# 2SWSG

This project aims to build a suckless Simple Static Web Site Generator.

## What do you mean by `suckless`?

This software is not made to have pretty and fancy features, aka the door to
become a bloated software. It goals is to make build and manage static websites.

Obviously it can have advanced and complex features but will stay logic with
itself. I.e: it won't bundle a spellchecker, visitor's replies, etc.

## What do you mean by `Simple`?

I believe when we want to make a website, we don't have to spend time on how
we have to write correctly tags, tuning CSS, etc. We only have to focus to write
what we want to. Furthermore, HTML is an hideous language, impossible to read
without annoyance for a human. That's why a supported language list is available
`(soon)`.

Another point about simple, is CSS don't watch about id and class and only tag
name. With that simplicity you can you a simple text parser to generate your
HTML without needing to insert somewhere the correct and cryptic class or id.

And last but not least, we don't have to use shitons of weird javascript snip
somewhere on the Internet to make the website to works. The strict minimal will
be used to ensure it to works (I don't know yet if it will none or a few lines).

## What do you mean by `Static`

There is no backend.

## What do you mean by `Web Site Generator`?

It. Generates. Website.

Nothing else. (Yeah I know, it also manage it. Useful thing to ensure a proper
administration (such as page update, 301 error code))
